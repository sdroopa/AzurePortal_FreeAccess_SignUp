## Introduction
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform. In Azure, we can develop the program or product, test and deploy it easily using their wide range of solutions.
Azure also provides the services by means of monitoring and managing these developed applications in terms of resources usage, application performances, logging about network traffic etc.
These solutions are widely classified into three categories : 
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)


## Outlook Account

I have office outlook account which is obviously paid by my organization to access azure services so I will not use that account and the services.
I will create new account for development and sharing knowledge purpose.

So what do we get when we sign up Azure Portal? The free subscription of azure portal comes with below benefits:

-Section 1 : Your profile section needs your first name, last name, phone and organization details. PAN number(like SSN number) is optional ,isn't it amazing  :-) :-) .

-Section 2 : Needs verification sms or call sent to your phone and once verified, go to section 3.

-Section 3 :  Needs credit card details, They will charge minimal amount Rs 2 and give it back to verify the card details are genuine.
Microsoft wont charge you automatically unless you would click on upgrade account or select "pay as you go " account.

If you want to use the same resources after 1 month or exhaustion of 13,300 credits, then you need to pay and upgrade your account to "pay as you go" .
	
In the next two months, I would check and explore the resources  free for next 11 months as  mentioned and would love to check the development options available to explore for free.

I would update post exhaustion of my free credits which resources I can still use it effectively for free and development purpose.
